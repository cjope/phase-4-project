Riverbend Garden\\u2019s operation is unique, propagating hundreds of rare Asiatic selections as well as field growing many of these hardy, hard- to- find gems in the farmlands of Chester NH. Most all of our rare plants will take winter extremes and cold hardy from USDA Hardiness Zones 4 to 6. When I\\u2019m not in the field or grafting trees, I\\u2019m busy in our pottery studio hand building and wheel throwing my popular line of high fired bonsai containers. Growing for bonsai and making bonsai pottery is my passion. We sincerely enjoy maintaining a lasting relationship with our customers who also have the same passion for their artistry; just another reason why we will only ship the finest quality, at the best price. I hope you\\u2019ll find that our plant selection and pottery will strengthen your enthusiasm to further embark on the truly fascinating art of bonsai. Much of our plant material is not listed and is available at nursery for customer pick-up. We have just added another greenhouse for 2021 so that we can hold over more plant material and expand on propagation. Our showroom also has more container selections and most all imported bonsai soils from Akadama & Kanuma to Lava Stone. If you have a special item or plant request, please write and I\\u2019ll see if we can ship items your way. Also, please make sure you\\u2019re on our newsletter mailings! We are looking forward to offering bonsai demonstrations & workshops at our new location in Chester, NH, so make sure I have your e-mail address.
